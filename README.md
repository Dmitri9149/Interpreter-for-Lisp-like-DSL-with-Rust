The project has to partly answer the question " How to to inject code to the running Rust program in simple way ?"    
The Rust interpreter for Lisp has to partly answer the question.    

There is excellent tutorial how to make [C interpreter for Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com/)     
And there is already good "translation" of the tutorial to the Rust:     
[Build your own Lisp with Rust](https://dev.to/deciduously/rust-your-own-lisp-50an)     


The project is based on the 2 above mentioned projects, because that give the good 'scaffold' for me.      
So, part of the code is based on the  [Build your own Lisp with Rust](https://dev.to/deciduously/rust-your-own-lisp-50an).   

The work is is progress.
